<title> analysis for system reliability - procedure for FMEA analysis</title>


what is fmea?

<p> a systematic procedure to analyse failure modes of a system their causes and effects on the system</p>

when is the fmea to be done?

<p> preferabilly early in the development cycle so that removal or mitigation is cost effective . can be innitiated as soon as the system is defined enough to be presented as a functional block diagram
 takes place along with the design process</p>

how to draw a functional block diagram?

refer IEC 61078- analysis for system reliability - reliability block diagram method

 what is the properties of the methodology?
<ul>
<li> bottom up methodology</li>
<ul>suitabel for idividual failues</li>
<ul>not suitable for dependant failures</li>
<ul>not sutable for failures depending on sequence of events</li>
</ul>

what is individual failure?

what is dependant failure?
[unanswered/ find answer for this]
- use 61165 (markov analysis) or 61025 fault tree analysis


what is a failure depending on sequence of events ?


[unanswered/ find answer for this]

what is the objective of the analysis?
<ul>
<li>identify failures having unwanted effects on system</li>
<li><li>preclude</li></li>
<li><li>user safety</li></li>
<li><li>significantly degrade operation</li></li>
<li> requirements satisfacetion</li>
<li> improve system reliablilty</li>
<li> maintenance schedule upon the risk </li>
</ul>
