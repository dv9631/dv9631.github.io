<h1>Clause: 4 risk analysis</h1>
<ol>
<li>Risk analysis process</li>
<ul>
<li>implementation of the planned risk analysis activities and the results of risk analysis shall be recorded in the risk managment file</li>
<li>description and identification of the device analysed</li>
<li>person and organisation carrying out the analysis</li>
<li>scope and date of the analysis</li>
</ul>
<li>intended use and identification of characteristics related to safety of the medical device</li>
<ul>
<li>document intended use</li>
<li>document forseable misuse</li>
<li>document quantitative and qualitative characteristics that could affect safety of the device,and teir defined limits</li>
<li>maintained in risk managment file</li>
</ul>
<li>identification of hazards</li>
<ul>
<li>known and forseable hazards associated with device in normal and fault conditions</li>
</ul>
<li> estimation of risk for each hazardous situation</li>
<ul>
<li>reasonably forseable sequences or combination of events that can result in hazardous situation shall be considered and resulting hazardous situation shall be recorded</li>
<li>estimate risk using available information for each hazardous situation</li>
<li>if probability of occurence of harm cannot be estimated,possible consequences shall be listed</li>
<li>system used for qualitative or quantitative categorisation of probability of occurence of harm or severity of harm shall be recoded</li>
<li>information or data for estimating risk can be obtained from:</li>
<ul>
<li>published standards</li>
<li>scientific technical data</li>
<li>field data from similar medical devices already in use ,including published reported incidents</li>
<li>usability tests employing typical users</li>
<li>clinical evidence</li>
<li>results of approperiate investigations</li>

<h2>Clause 5 : Risk evaluation</h2>
<ul>
<li>guidance for risk acceptability</li>
<li>each hazard identified, decide if risk reduction is required or not</li>
</ul>
<h2>Clause 6 : Risk control</h2>
<ol>
<li>risk reduction</li>
<li>risk control option analysis</li> 
<ul>
<li>identify risk control measures approperiate for reducing risk</li>
<ul>
<li>inherent safety by design</li>
<li>protective measure in the medical device itself or in manufacturing process</li>
<li>information for safety</li>
</ul>
<li>measure selected must be recorded in risk managment file</li>
<li>if risk reduction is not practicable, risk benefit analysis to be performed</li>
</ul>
<li>implementation of risk control measures</li>
<ul>
<li>implementation of each risk control measure must be verified and recorded</li>
<li>effectiveness verified</li>
</ul>
<li>Residual risk evaluation</li>
<ul>
<li>after risk control measure applied,residual risk evaluated</li>
<li>residual risk not aceptable,further risk control measures must apply</li>
<li>for residual risks acceptable,manufacturer to decide which to disclose and what information is necessary to include in documents</li>
</ul>
<li>risk benefit analysis</li>
<ul>
<li>not acceptable residual risk,further risk control is not practicable,gather and review data and literature to determine if intended use otweighs residual risk</li>
<li>if evidence does not support conclusion that medical benefits outweigh residual risk,then risk remains unacceptable</li>
<li>if benefit outweighs risk, information for safety to be disclosed</li>
</ul>
<li>risk arising from risk control measures</li>
<ul>
<li>introduction of new hazards,hazardous situation</li>
<li>risk control measure affects estimated risk for previous identified hazardous situation</li>
</ul>
<li>completeness of risk control</li>
<ul>
<li>risks from all identified hazardous situations haave been considered</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<h2>Clause 7 : Evaluation of overall residual risk</h2>
<ul>
<li>overall residual risk posed by the medical device is acceptable using the criteria defined</li>
<li>gather and review data and literature to determine if medical benefits of intended use outweigh the overall residual risk</li> 
</ul>
<h2>Clause 8: Risk managemnt report</h2>
<ul>
<li>review of risk managment process</li>
<li>risk managemnt plan has been approperiately implemented</li>
<li>overal residual risk is acceptable</li>
<li>approperiate methods are in place to obtain relevant production and post production information</li>
<li>rewiew recorded as risk managment report and included in risk managment file</li>
</ul>
<h2>Clause 9:Production and post production information</h2>
<ul>
<li>establish system to collect and review information about the medical device in production and post production phase</li>
<li>information generated by operator,user,those accountable for installation use and maintenance is collected and processed</li>
<li>publicly available information about similar medical devices</li>
<li>if previously unrecognised hazards or hazardous situvations are present</li>
<li>estimared risk arising from a hazardous situvation is/are no longer acceptable</li>
<li>impact on previously implemented risk managment activities shall be evaluated and fed back as an input to the risk managment process</li>
<li>review of risk managment file conducted, if potential of residual risk or its acceptability has changed, the impact on the previously implemented risk control measure must be evaluated</li>
